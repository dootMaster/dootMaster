# Leslie

Software engineer with a demonstrated mindset for clean, modular code in order to achieve scalability and optimization. I work with JavaScript, TypeScript, React.js, Express.js, various CSS libraries, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, AWS, and NGINX to create full-stack applications. I'm currently developing a web application that helps guitarists improve their fretboard navigation abilities.

Outside of work, I like to play guitar and cook nice meals.

## Projects

- **Key Frame Guitar** - A music practice application I built using React inspired by key frames in animation. This app takes user input and creates fretboard maps of intersecting harmonies.

- **Atelier Product API** - An API that provides data to a fashion products merchant site. Three instances of Express.js servers were deployed via AWS behind an NGINX load balancer and connected to a server hosting a database powered by PostgreSQL. I wrote K6 tests that created up to 3000 virtual users that bombard the load balancer with requests in order to locate where optimizations can be performed.

- **project:CATWALK** - An e-commerce React application where I built the "Related Products" module. I made carousels from scratch to enhance customizability. I also built a data algorithm that both reduced requests made to the API as well as improved the speed of responses to user actions.

- **Metronome** - A metronome I built based on Grant James' scheduling algorithm using React. `setInterval` is not accurate enough for musicians to keep time, and this app employs a combination of `setInterval` and Web Audio API's `currentTime` method to ensure that timing is robust and usable for practice.
